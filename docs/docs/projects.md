### Galton Board Simulator

The [Galton Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board), also known as the Galton box, quincunx or bean machine, is a device that visually demonstrates the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) by dropping balls through a pegged board, resulting in a distribution that approximates a normal distribution.

I developed a 2D simulator as an Android app using [box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) as a physics engine. It uses the accelerometer in the phone to change the gravity in the application, resulting in a different distribution.
