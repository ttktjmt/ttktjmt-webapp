### **Galton Board Simulator** <a href="https://github.com/ttktjmt/galtonboard-qt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Source Code" style="float: right; margin-right: 2rem;"> :simple-github: </a>

The [Galton Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board), also known as the Galton box, quincunx or bean machine, is a device that visually demonstrates the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) by dropping balls through a pegged board, resulting in a distribution that approximates a normal distribution.<br>
I developed a 2D simulator as an Android app using [box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) as a physics engine. It uses the accelerometer in the phone to change the gravity in the application, resulting in a different distribution.

### **Company Website** <a href="https://mu-borg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Home Page" style="float: right; margin-right: 2rem;"> :material-web: </a>

I developed and published a website for the company that was launched from the university laboratory I was affiliated with, using Notion and Cloudflare.
I also carried out tasks such as registering domain names and creating email addresses for them.

### **Voice Controlled Robot Hand** <a href="https://youtu.be/zjVYmhg9dLg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Video" style="float: right; margin-right: 2rem;"> :simple-youtube: </a>

I built my own robot hand from cardboard, servo motors, string, etc., connected it to a Raspberry Pi and a USB microphone, and used voice recognition to control it with my voice.<br>
The idea behind this project was to enable anyone to operate a high DOF prosthetic hand without training, as I felt that operating a prosthetic hand with electrical signals from muscles is intuitive but difficult to achieve high DOF.
