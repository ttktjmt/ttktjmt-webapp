### **MyoChallenge 2024** [:material-web:](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite/myochallenge/myochallenge-2024){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Official Website" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"} [:material-file-document:](blog/posts/myochallenge2024/comprehensive-guide.md){:rel="noopener noreferrer" title="My Blog" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"}

As a member of the [MyoSuite](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite){:target="_blank"} community and the MyoChallenge Advocacy Team, I created a [blog](blog/posts/myochallenge2024/comprehensive-guide.md){:target="_blank"} explaining the general process of participating in the [MyoChallenge 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite/myochallenge/myochallenge-2024){:target="_blank"} competition.

### **Galton Board Simulator** [:simple-github:](https://github.com/ttktjmt/galtonboard-qt){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Source Code" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"}

The [Galton Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board){:target="_blank"}, also known as the Galton box, quincunx or bean machine, is a device that visually demonstrates the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem){:target="_blank"} by dropping balls through a pegged board, resulting in a normal distribution.<br>
I developed a 2D simulator as an Android app using [box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d){:target="_blank"} as a physics engine. It uses the accelerometer sensor in the phone to change the gravity in the application, resulting in a different distribution.

### **Company Website** [:material-web:](https://mu-borg.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Home Page" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"}

I developed and published a website for the company that was launched from the university laboratory I was affiliated with, using Notion and Cloudflare. I also carried out tasks such as registering domain names and creating email addresses for them.

### **Voice Controlled Robot Hand** [:simple-youtube:](https://youtu.be/zjVYmhg9dLg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Video" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"}

I built my own robot hand from cardboard, servo motors, string, etc., connected it to a Raspberry Pi and a USB microphone, and used voice recognition to control it with my voice.<br>
The idea behind this project was to enable anyone to operate a high DOF prosthetic hand without training, as I felt that operating a prosthetic hand with electrical signals from muscles is intuitive but difficult to achieve high DOF.

### **TETRIS on Arduino Game Console** [:simple-youtube:](https://youtu.be/Kmq4INAJUeA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Video" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"} [:simple-googledrive:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XIpsRjvyxm8ZJICFTqMlnAM3WdH2CrXw?usp=drive_link){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="More Resources" style="float: right; margin-right: 1rem;"}

I created a classic game console using an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano){:target="_blank"} and a lot of LEDs. To extend the controllable pin capacity of the Arduino Nano, I used shift registers ([SN74HC595](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595){:target="_blank"}). I soldered 136 LEDs by hand onto a universal board (I know, it's a menace...), allowing independent control of each LED via the Arduino Nano. Using matrix processing, I developed TETRIS in the Arduino language, carefully implementing boundary conditions and block collision avoidance to ensure that the game runs smoothly and is less prone to bugs.
