I have focused on deepening my knowledge in various programming languages including C and Python. My coursework covered the basics of these programming languages, extending to more complex applications such as the implementation of the least squares method and Fourier transform. Furthermore, I explored AI technologies, diving into the mathematical basics of dimensionality reduction methods and image recognition using Python.

- Thesis titled "Evaluation of the Impact of Feature Space Display Function on the Discrimination Performance of Multi-DoF Myoelectric Prosthetic Hands." This research introduced a novel training method incorporating feedback through a feature space graph. The graph illustrated relationships between various hand motions (e.g., grasping, open hand, pinching) employing a dimensionality reduction technique. Additionally, developed an Android application to support the thesis findings.

I developed and proposed a novel approach to myoelectric prosthetic hand training by introducing real-time feature space visualization. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) to convert complex electromyography (EMG) data into an intuitive two-dimensional format, I enhanced the training experience for users, particularly novices. The core of my project involved developing an Android app for real-time, accessible feedback, leading to improved user proficiency and performance.
