:trophy: &nbsp; **Achievements** <br>

Our lab successfully commercialized a cyborg prosthetic hand with five independently controlled fingers and an adaptive learning function approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. This is the 2nd electric prosthetic hand covered by insurance in Japan, approved by the goverment, and made in Japan.

:trophy: &nbsp; **Awards** <br>

Elected [Valedictorian at graduation](https://megurokai.jp/home2/2022megurokaisho/){:target="_blank"} and recieved the Meguro Association Award for highest academic achievement

:mag: &nbsp; **Research** <br>

I developed and proposed a novel approach to myoelectric prosthetic hand training by introducing real-time feature space visualization. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) to convert complex electromyography (EMG) data into an intuitive two-dimensional format, I enhanced the training experience for users, particularly novices. The core of my project involved developing an Android app for real-time, accessible feedback, leading to improved user proficiency and performance.
