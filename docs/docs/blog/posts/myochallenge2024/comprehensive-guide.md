## :mechanical_arm: **Understand MyoSuite**

![MyoSuite Logo](https://github.com/myohub/myosuite/blob/main/docs/source/images/Full%20Color%20Horizontal%20wider.png?raw=true){: style="width: 80%;"}

MyoSuite is the foundation of MyoChallenge. It's a platform with a collection of environments/tasks to be solved by musculoskeletal models to understand human dexterity and agility, developed by researchers at Meta AI. You can learn basic information about it from these places to get started:

- [:material-web: MyoSuite Official Website](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite){:target="_blank"}
- [:simple-github: GitHub - myosuite](https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite){:target="_blank"}
- [:simple-readthedocs: Welcome to MyoSuite’s documentation!](https://myosuite.readthedocs.io/){:target="_blank"}

### **Do you know `gym`?**

MyoSuite is basically a superset of [`gymnasium`](https://gymnasium.farama.org){:target="_blank"} (former [`gym`](https://github.com/openai/gym){:target="_blank"} maintained by OpenAI) with musculoskeletal extensions, and it generally adheres to its usage.

If you're not familiar with the `gymnasium`, it is highly recommended to get familiar with it first.  

### **Learn Usage with Tutorial**

To get hands-on with MyoSuite, follow the tutorials provided in the official documentation. These tutorials cover various aspects of using MyoSuite, from setting up the environment to running simulations. Especially, it’s better to check the section [“Using Reinforcement Learning”](https://myosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#using-reinforcement-learning){:target="_blank"} because that is essentially the same process you’ll follow to check you own policy.
