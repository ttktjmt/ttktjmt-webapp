# Discovering the Best Way to Learn a Language

Last year, I participated in a Japanese program called Vulcanus in Europe, which involved spending six months studying German at a language school in Germany, followed by a six-month full-time internship at a German company.

In this blog, I will share the insights I gained from learning German throughout the year and the discoveries I made about effective language acquisition.

## Initial Learning Experience

When I started learning German, I had no prior knowledge (A1 level). After six months of studying at a language school, I reached a level where I could barely manage basic conversations (B1 level). Even after the language school period ended, I continued studying German daily using language learning apps like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com){:target="_blank"} and [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/){:target="_blank"}.

However, around nine months into my German studies, I realized that my progress was not matching the effort I was putting in. I felt a growing sense of unease about whether I was on the right track. Knowing that some people advanced from A1 to C1 within six months at language school made me question the gap between their progress and mine.

Believing that there were many other people who might share my frustrations, I decided to investigate scientific research on language learning. The internet was flooded with anecdotal advice, often with high price tags, so I focused on scholarly articles and reputable academics. This led me to [Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis){:target="_blank"}.

## Discovering the Input Hypothesis

The Input Hypothesis, in a nutshell, suggests that the most effective way to acquire a second language is through receiving large amounts of comprehensible input, which means language that is slightly above the learner's current level (i+1). Key points from this hypothesis include:

- The need for comprehensible input
- The importance of sustained exposure over time
- The limited role of output (speaking/writing), especially in early stages

Krashen argues that these principles are fundamental for language acquisition. It's naive to say "Input Is All You Need", but it's worth mentioning that input plays a key role in language acquisition.

## Personal Insights on Language Learning

On discovering this hypothesis, I finally understood how I had learned English. Although I still have many things to learn about English, I was often asked how I became proficient in it, and I struggled to give a clear answer. My strong motivation to learn English from middle school led me to various activities - watching English gaming videos on YouTube, participating in exchange programs in the US, and practicing with international students in Japan. I thought each method contributed to my English skills, but I couldn't pinpoint which method was most effective.

Krashen’s theory clarified my experience: I had been continuously receiving comprehensible input over a long period while enjoying the process.

## Changing My Strategy

Inspired by this realization, I significantly changed my approach to learning German. I shifted from "studying" to genuinely "acquiring" the language through enjoyable and effective methods. Specifically, I uninstalled Duolingo and Busuu and focused on the following activities:

1. **Watching Studio Ghibli movies in German**
    
    Re-watching these films helped me get extended periods of comprehensible input. Being familiar with the storylines made it easier to infer the meanings of unknown words, which greatly expanded my vocabulary.
    
2. **Watching short videos on TikTok in German**
    
    This method is great for those who struggle with motivation. Short videos allow you to experience how native speakers communicate and learn about their culture. TikTok's algorithm also helps by showing content that matches your interests, turning the addictive nature of short videos into a learning advantage. Setting the app to German content is particularly effective.
    
3. **Listening to German podcasts**
    
    Once you reach a certain level of comprehension, podcasts become a powerful source of input. Unlike other methods, you cannot turn on subtitles, so some understanding is necessary. Finding podcasts on topics you genuinely enjoy allows you to make use of downtime, like doing chores or commuting. My recommendation is to listen to content that interests you rather than language learning podcasts.

## Reflections    

Implementing these methods and significantly increasing the time spent on them led to noticeable improvements in my German, especially in comprehension and speaking skills. By the end of my stay in Germany, I was able to converse almost entirely in German at my farewell party with my co-workers.

Although I’m not yet confident enough to say that “I am fluent in German,"  I am now assured that with the right approach and sufficient time, I can achieve it. Moreover, I’ve discovered that learning a new language can be more enjoyable and exciting than commonly believed, motivating me to continue exploring new languages. And it’s free!!

Finally, it’s important to note, however, that while Krashen’s Input Hypothesis is influential and widely regarded, it is not universally accepted as the definitive method for language acquisition. The field of language learning is still evolving, and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of how best to learn new languages. If you are interested, I also recommend you fall into the rabbit hole with me!!
